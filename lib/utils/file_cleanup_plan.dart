  /// 
  /// 1. For high confidence files:
  ///    - Rename the file to add "_unused" suffix
  ///    - Run the app and verify it still works
  ///    - If no issues, delete the file
  /// 
  /// 2. For medium confidence files:
  ///    - Search for all occurrences of the class name
  ///    - Check if it's imported dynamically or used via reflection
  ///    - Only delete if you're confident it's unused
  /// 
  /// 3. For large files:
  ///    - Extract components into separate files
  ///    - Reduce code duplication
  ///    - Consider using more composition
  ///
  /// 4. For single import files:
  ///    - Consider merging with their only consumer if appropriate
  ///    - Or keep them separate if they represent a clean abstraction
