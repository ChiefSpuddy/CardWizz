## How to Address These Issues
1. **Large Assets**: Compress images using tools like TinyPNG or WebP format
2. **Unused Dependencies**: Remove or replace rarely used packages
3. **Widget Optimization**: Convert StatefulWidgets to StatelessWidgets where possible
4. **Missing Const**: Add const keyword to eligible widget constructors
5. **Memory Leak Risks**: Ensure proper resource disposal in dispose() methods
6. **Debug Statements**: Remove print/debug statements before production build
